In that case, there may be tips hidden in the websi... wait, Daniel, can we say that? Well... anyway, you can interpret that as you want. There will also be tasks that are connected to the terminal, and to be clear, u can use the entire website and its options to solve the tasks. Some tasks are just ciphers, and other more tricky</h1>
